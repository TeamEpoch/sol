### Info

`f32x4` is a vector of four 32-bit floats, as the name implies.

### Accessors

#### x

`x` is the scalar accessor the x element of `f32x4`. Perhaps confusingly
to newcomers, it may also be used to set the element of `x`-- to keep things
simple, this is just because `x` is a macro.

```C
f32x4 v;
x(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", x(v));
```

#### y

`y` is the scalar accessor for the y element of `f32x4`. It behaves identically
to `x`.

```C
f32x4 v;
y(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", y(v));
```

#### z

`z` is the scalar accessor for the z element of `f32x4`. It behaves identically
to `x`.

```C
f32x4 v;
z(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", z(v));
```

#### w

`w` is the scalar accessor for the w element of `f32x4`. It behaves identically
to `x`.

```C
f32x4 v;
w(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", w(v));
```

### Initializers

#### f32x4_set

```C
f32x4 f32x4_set(f32 x, f32 y, f32 z, f32 w);
```

`f32x4_set` is the basic initializer for the `f32x4` type.

#### f32x4_setf

`f32x4_setf` is the scalar initializer for the `f32x4` type.

To put it simply, `f32x4_setf(f)` is equivalent to `f32x2_set(f, f)`, except in
that `f` is only evaluated once.

#### f32x4_zero

`f32x4_zero` is the zero initialzier for the `f32x4` type.

To put it simply, `f32x4_zero()` is equivalent to `f32x4_setf(0.0f)`, which in
turn is equivaelnt to `f32x4_set(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)`.

### Basic Math

#### f32x4_sum

```C
f32 f32x4_sum(f32x4 v);
```

`f32x4_sum` finds the sum of all elements in a vector.

To put it simply, `f32x4_sum(v)` is equivalent to `x(v) + y(v) + z(v) + w(v)`.

#### f32x4_sq

```C
f32x4 f32x4_sq(f32x4 v);
```

`f32x4_sq` squares each element of a vector.

To put it simply, `f32x4_sq(v)` is equivalent to `f32x4_mul(v, v)`, except in
that `v` is only evaluated once.

```C
f32x4 v = f32x4_sq(f32x4_set(2.0f, 4.0f, 6.0f, 8.0f));
printf("%f, %f\n", x(v), y(v)); // 4.0, 16.0, 36.0, 64.0
```

#### f32x4_add

```C
f32x4 f32x4_add(f32x4 a, f32x4 b);
```

`f32x4_add` does an element-wise addition of the two input vectors.

#### f32x4_addf

```C
f32x4 f32x4_addf(f32x4 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x4_addf` adds a scalar to each element of a vector.

#### f32x4_sub

```C
f32x4 f32x4_sub(f32x4 a, f32x4 b);
```

`f32x4_sub` does an element-wise subtraction of the two input vectors.

#### f32x4_subf

```C
f32x4 f32x4_subf(f32x4 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x4_subf` subtracts a scalar from each element of a vector.

#### f32x4_fsub

```C
f32x4 f32x4_fsub(f32 f, f32x4 b);
```

`f32x4_fsub` subtracts each element of a vector from a scalar.

#### f32x4_mul

```C
f32x4 f32x4_mul(f32x4 a, f32x4 b);
```

`f32x4_mul` does an element-wise multiplication of the two input vectors.

#### f32x4_mulf

```C
f32x4 f32x4_mulf(f32x4 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x4_mulf` multiplies each element of a vector by a scalar.

#### f32x4_div

```C
f32x4 f32x4_div(f32x4 a, f32x4 b);
```

`f32x4_div` does an element-wise division of the two input vectors.

#### f32x4_divf

```C
f32x4 f32x4_divf(f32x4 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x4_divf` divides of each element of a vector by a scalar.

#### f32x4_fdiv

```C
f32x4 f32x4_fdiv(f32 f, f32x4 v);
```

`f32x4_fdiv` divides a scalar by each element of a vector.

#### f32x4_fma

```C
f32x4 f32x4_fma(f32x4 a, f32x4 b, f32x4 c);
```

`f32x4_fma` does a fused multiply-add of the three input vectors.

#### f32x4_fms

```C
f32x4 f32x4_fms(f32x4 a, f32x4 b, f32x4 c);
```

`f32x4_fms` does a fused multiply-subtract of the three input vectors.
