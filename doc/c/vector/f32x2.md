### Info

`f32x2` is a vector of two 32-bit floats, as the name implies.

### Accessors

#### x

`x` is the scalar accessor for the x element of `f32x2`. Perhaps confusingly
to newcomers, it may also be used to set the element of `x`-- to keep things
simple, this is just because `x` is a macro.

```C
f32x2 v;
x(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", x(v));
```

#### y

`y` is the scalar accessor for the y element of `f32x2`. It behaves identically
to `x`.

```C
f32x2 v;
y(v) = 5.0f;
printf("%f\n", y(v));
```

### Initializers

#### f32x2_set

```C
f32x2 f32x2_set(f32 x, f32 y);
```

`f32x2_set` is the basic initializer for the `f32x2` type.

```C
f32x2 v = f32x2_set(0.0f, 0.1f);
printf("%f\n", y(v));
```

#### f32x2_setf

```C
f32x2 f32x2_setf(f32 f);
```

`f32x2_setf` is the scalar initializer for the `f32x2` type.

To put it simply, `f32x2_setf(f)` is equivalent to `f32x2_set(f, f)`, except in
that `f` is only evaluated once.

```C
f32x2 v = f32x2_setf(2.0f);
assert(x(v) == y(v));
```

#### f32x2_zero

```C
f32x2 f32x2_zero(void);
```

`f32x2_zero` is the zero initializer for the `f32x2` type.

To put it simply, `f32x2_zero()` is equivalent to `f32x2_setf(0.0f)`, which in
turn is equivalent to `f32x2_set(0.0f, 0.0f)`.

```C
f32x2 v = f32x2_zero();
assert(x(v) == 0.0f);
assert(y(v) == 0.0f);
```

### Basic Math

#### f32x2_sum

```C
f32 f32x2_sum(f32x2 v);
```

`f32x2_sum` finds the sum of all elements in a vector.

To put it simply, `f32x2_sum(v)` is equivalent to `x(v) + y(v)`.

```C
f32x2 v = f32x2_setf(5.0);
printf("%f\n", f32x2_sum(v)); // 10.0
```

#### f32x2_sq

```C
f32x2 f32x2_sq(f32x2 v);
```

`f32x2_sq` squares each element of a vector.

To put it simply, `f32x2_sq(v)` is equivalent to `f32x2_mul(v, v)`, except in
that `v` is only evalauted once.

```C
f32x2 v = f32x2_sq(f32x2_set(2.0f, 4.0f));
printf("%f, %f\n", x(v), y(v)); // 4.0, 16.0
```

#### f32x2_add

```C
f32x2 f32x2_add(f32x2 a, f32x2 b);
```

`f32x2_add` does an element-wise addition of the two input vectors.

#### f32x2_addf

```C
f32x2 f32x2_addf(f32x2 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x2_addf` adds a scalar to each element of a vector.

#### f32x2_sub

```C
f32x2 f32x2_sub(f32x2 a, f32x2 b);
```

`f32x2_sub` does an element-wise subtraction of the two input vectors.

#### f32x2_subf

```C
f32x2 f32x2_subf(f32x2 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x2_subf` subtracts a scalar from each element of a vector.

#### f32x2_fsub

```C
f32x2 f32x2_fsub(f32 f, f32x2 v);
```

`f32x2_fsub` subtracts each element of a vector from a scalar.

#### f32x2_mul

```C
f32x2 f32x2_mul(f32x2 a, f32x2 b);
```

`f32x2_mul` does an element-wise multiplication of the two input vectors.

#### f32x2_mulf

```C
f32x2 f32x2_mulf(f32x2 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x2_mulf` multiplies each element of a vector by a scalar.

#### f32x2_div

```C
f32x2 f32x2_div(f32x2 a, f32x2 b);
```

`f32x2_div` does an element-wise division of the two input vectors.

#### f32x2_divf

```C
f32x2 f32x2_divf(f32x2 v, f32 f);
```

`f32x2_divf` divides each element of a vector by a scalar.

#### f32x2_fdiv

```C
f32x2 f32x2_fdiv(f32 f, f32x2 v);
```

`f32x2_fdiv` divides a scalar by each element of a vector.

#### f32x2_fma

```C
f32x2 f32x2_fma(f32x2 a, f32x2 b, f32x2 c);
```

`f32x2_fma` does a fused multiply-add of the three input vectors.

### f32x2_fms

```C
f32x2 f32x2_fms(f32x2 a, f32x2 b, f32x2 c);
```

`f32x2_fms` does a fused multiply-subtract of the three input vectors.
